# Overview

On a bluff overlooking and right next to the sea, the Bird Crag is one of the most picturesque climbing areas on the island.  Situated on the sea road between the villages of Sadrazamkoy and Kayalar -- and nearby a tiny Greek Orthodox chapel on the beach -- the Bird Crag offers high quality climbs from beginner grades to 7b.  Please note that climbing in this area is restricted from 01 January to 01 July (nesting season for the birds after which it is eponymously named).  Also beware loose rock around the climbs (stay on route to minimize rock fall danger).  And as always, be mindful of stepping on a blunt-nosed viper.

# Directions

The crag is 50m uphill from the sea road, about halfway between the villages of Sadrazamkoy and Kayalar.  Park off the road on the inland side and walk up the trail near the left side.
