# Overview

Bouldering in Cyprus is mainly concentrated in the area of Droushia/Ineia.

# [Droushia/Ineia]({{<ref "/areas/droushia/overview" >}})

![Droushia](/droushia/bouldering_001.jpg)

The most extensive bouldering on the island. Several tens of potential boulders in a small area of approximately 4 square kilometres. Includes probably the steepest boulder on the island - a 25 foot roof. More details can be found here. Note: a fantastic new topo for the Droushia area has been produced by local bouldering aficionados.

# [Limnitis]({{<ref "limnitis/overview" >}})

![Limnitis](/limnitis/limnitis_boulder.jpg)

Two boulders in a remote, peaceful location overlooking Morphou Bay, close to the coastline. One of the boulders is pretty massive by Cyprus standards and is well worth spending a day at. Also an overhaning wall about 60m long. More details can be found here.

# [Agios Georgios]({{<ref "happy-valley/bouldering" >}})

An extensiive set of boulders scattered around the vicinity of the Agios Georgios climbing sector. Unfortunately, the boulders are often sharp and the problems yielded tend to be towards the lower end of the bouldering scale, although with one or two harder problems thrown in. More details, including topo, can be found here.

# [Cavo Greko]({{<ref "cavo-greko/bouldering" >}})

# [Episkopi Limassol]()

# [Agios Irakleidhios]({{<ref "agios-irakleidhios/overview" >}})

An area located close to the Agios Irakleidhios monastery, but without the access difficulties. More information to be provided in due course.

# [Oroklini Quarry]({{<ref "oroklini/overview" >}})

Old school bouldering in an old school disused quarry. High ball and loose and well worth a visit. Make sure your health insurance is up to date üòÅ. Located just west of Oroklini, not far from Larnaca.
