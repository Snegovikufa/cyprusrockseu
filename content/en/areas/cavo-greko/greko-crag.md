Greko crag is located on the upper tier of the Greko peninsula. It is home to many fine trad routes, mainly in the lower grades, some of which are multi-pitch. The rock is probably the best in the Greko area, more weathered and consolidated than other parts. The raised aspect gives a real sense of height to the routes and gives great views.

# Directions

Best accessed from the lower viewpoint parking area. Follow the small path that leads west out of the far end of the car park, and follow it as it descends past western edge the crag. A path then follows the line of the whole crag.

# Aspect

Faces West/South West Receives sun from late morning to early afternoon to late evening.

# Notes

Due to the tourist viewpoint at the top of the crag, use of helmets is strongly advised.

Some of the sports routes on this sector were bolted quite a few years ago and the bolts should be treated with extreme caution and backed up where possible. The exception to this are four new sports routes installed to the right of Hung Over. These are recent additions to the sector, and are sound (Luna Park,Vasanaki, Tall Beauty, Devil's Feet).
