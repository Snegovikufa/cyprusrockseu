An easily accessible crag with more short routes. Probably the least promising of Greko's crags, but still worthwhile. Faces south east so suitable for a spot of evening cragging during the hotter months.

# Directions

Keep on the small road that passes the (sign-posted) track to the viewpoint area. When the road bends left towards Protaras, take the road that leads to the tip of Greko. Continue downhill and the road bends right then left (military base to the right). Continue past the track to Tigani Rocks for 200m and take a small track on the left. You can park practically at the base of the crag.

# Aspect

Faces East/South East Receives sun until mid afternoon.
