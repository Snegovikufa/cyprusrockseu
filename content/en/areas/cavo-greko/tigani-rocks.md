An easily accessible crag with more good short routes. Again heavily fearured and occasionally slightly loose and brittle.

# Directions

Keep on the small road that passes the (sign-posted) track to the viewpoint area. When the road bends left towards Protaras, take the road that leads to the tip of Greko. Continue downhill and the road bends right then left (military base to the right). Just after the the left bend an obvious farm track is on the right. Either park here, or take the farm track and continue for about 400m and then park. Tigani Rocks starts around 400m further west.
# Aspect

Faces South East Receives sun until mid to late afternoon.
