A small compact crag with a few good routes, spread out through the grades. The rock is fairly good quality and reasonably stable. Descent from a short scramble on the left of the crag as viewed from below.

# Directions

If a 4x4 is available then it's possible to take the track immediately before the viewpoint track and drive to a small parking area immediately in front of the crag. Alternatively, park in the lower viewpoint car park. Follow the small track west out of the car park, until it joins a bigger track. Here go right for a short distrance, then follow another rough track west and downwards for about 100m. This joins another bigger track; follow this to the left for 400m until the crag is reached.

# Aspect

Faces South West Receives sun from late morning to late evening.
