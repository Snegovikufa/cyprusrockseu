Interesting crag with great views over Lara Bay area. Home to several easy slab routes and a few traditional lines. In places exceeds 40m in height.

# Directions

Starting from Ineia, pass through the village heading west. Pass the coop bank and coffee shop on the right, and at the three way crossroads take the lower (left) road. Follow the small road for approx 1.5km. The rock appears on the right hand side of the road. Continue on the road for 200m more, and park in the obvious area 20m below the west face of the crag.

# Aspect
Faces South/West South face gets the sun most of the day. West face is in the shade until around midday - except in the 3-4 weeks before/after the summer solstice, when there is very little shade.

# Notes

If you like easy climbing, then a good day out during the summer is to visit Alikou in the morning, have lunch in the shade of the big tree, then visit Gerakopetra north face in the afternoon (**provided it is not less than 4 weeks either side of midsummer**).

There is another bolted route on the north edge of the rock (far left as you face the rock), and another bolted route (nana) on the steep sector about 50m to the left of the rock (again as you face it). Neither of these routes ap pear to be maintained, and at last visit the bolts seemed to be in poor condition. If you really want to try these, then caution is advised.

The information in the UKC database is mostly incorrect, and the trad routes in particular refer to an entirely different crag.
# Descent

For descent simply walk off the back of the crag, or rap back down the way you've come - will require a halfway pit stop (MAKE SURE TO KNOT YOUR ROPE).

| ------ | ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | F5a   | 25m    | Just around the left hand corner of the main face. Clamber onto a gentle slope, then continue up a vertical face on good (if lichenous) holds. Amusing.                                                                                                           |
| 1      | F4+   | 25m    | Follow the left hand-side of the crag to about two thirds height. Ring bolt lower-off. Note: at last visit the third or fourth bolt is missing the hanger                                                                                                         |
| 2      | F4    | 25m    | Climb about 2m right of the previous route to about two thirds height. Ring bolt lower-off.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3      | HD    | 40m    | Layback up the huge flake (unsettlingly hollow), traverse right and finish up the crack.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4      | F4    | 38m    | Tackle the large slab starting 2m right of the previous route. Below the half height bulge follow the left bolt (a couple of long quickdraws useful). Take the bulge direct. Belay at the top via the ring bolts, and either walk off the back, or rap back down. |
| 5      | F3+   | 38m    | This route starts a few metres off the ground, on the broken rocks, about 4m right of the previous route. Belay at the top via the ring bolts, and either walk off the back, or rap back down.                                                                    |
| 6      | F6a   | 42m    | Starts at the base of the crag, a few metres right of the previous route. Crux in first few metres. Belay at the top via the ring bolts, and either walk off the back, or rap back down.                                                                          |
| 7      | F6a   | 42m    | Starts at the base of the crag, a few metres right of the previous route. Crux is first few metres then easy F3 climbing to top. Belay at the top via the ring bolts, and either walk off the back, or rap back down.                                             |
| 8      | F6a   | 42m    | Starts at the base of the crag, a few metres right of the previous route. Like its neighbour, the crux is first few metres; then easy F3 climbing to top. Belay at the top via the ring bolts, and either walk off the back, or rap back down.                    |
