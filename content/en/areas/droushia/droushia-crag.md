Crag with a few sport routes.

# Directions

Not easy to find. Follow the small road north out of Droushia. After about 800m take the right fork in the road, and after another 800m the left. Follow the road downhill for another 400m and the crag will appear on the left. Small parking place just off the road on the left. You may need to supplement this with the google maps ref.
# Aspect

Faces North Gets the sun to mid-morning then from mid to late afternoon.
