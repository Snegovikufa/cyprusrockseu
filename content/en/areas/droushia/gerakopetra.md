Excellent crag with many good sports routes, commanding great views over the Akamas peninsula and Lara bay. Reaches a height of 40m in places and some of the routes require two pitches.

# Directions

Starting from Ineia, pass through the village heading NorthWest. Pass the coop bank and coffee shop on the right, and at the three way crossroads take the middle road. At the junction bear left and head out of the village. Continue for about 1km (passing a road sign-posted to Droushia on the right). After the road starts to descend, two small roads appear on the left. The second leads to the army base and is guarded by "strictly no entry" signs. Follow this road is marked as no entry, ignore the signs and continue for about 500m. Just as the road bends left to head for the camp, take the small track (easily missed) on the right. If you have a good 4-wheel vehicle then you can follow the track to its end at the top of the crag. Alternatively park at the entrance to the track or continute down the track and park on the left half-way along before the it starts to descend.

# Aspect
Faces North-east and north-west. North-east face (containing the easier routes) gets the sun until after mid-day. In mid-summer it remains in the sun until around 3PM except under the big overhang. North-west face gets the sun from around mid-day onwards.

# Notes

Its elevation of around 600m and North/East and North/West facing aspect makes this a good summer choice.

| --- | ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.  | Alexandros        | F6a   | 15m    | Interesting start leads to easier ground.                                                              |
| 2.  | Monaxiko Pnevma   | F5a   | 20m    | Tricky move quarter of the way up leads to easier climbing above. Take care with rope drag at the top. |
| 3.  | Vasiliko Pronomio | F6a+  | 20m    | The difficult moves at the second bolt are slightly easier on the left. Good balance helps.            |
| 4.  | Proti Epafi       | F5b   | 13m    |                                                                                                        |
| 5.  | G.A.P             | F5c   | 15m    | Good route and tricky for the grade.                                                                   |

| 7.  | Irmos             | F4    | 10m    |                                                                                                        |
| 8.  | Kondi             | F4    | 20m    | Nice introduction to the crag. Originally short (thus the name) but now much longer.                   |
| 9.  | Agnoumenos        | F4+   | 12m    | Another nice slab route.                                                                               |
| 10. | Eleana            | F5a   | 16m    | Yet another nice route                                                                                 |
| 11. | Pare Me           | F5b   | 17m    | Difficult move high up.                                                                                |

| 12. | Frixos                                | F5b   | 17m    | Great route up the steep corner. Feels like a trad route (and it was once!).                                                            |
| 13. | Andreas Prodromou & Haris Haralambous | F5c   | 15m    | Another great route up the edge of the overhang.                                                                                        |
| 14. | Kathodigitis                          | F6a   | 17m    | An even better route than the previous two. Very steep at the top, but huge bucket holds compensate.                                    |
| 15. | Nomos Varititas                       | F7a   | 15m    | The huge overhang it taken direct at its biggest span. Originally done as a traditionally protected route, which must have been fun (!) |
| 16. | Kanourgia Zoi                         | F6b+  | 25m    |                                                                                                                                         |
| 17. | Krimmenos Thisauros                   | F6b+  | 32m    |                                                                                                                                         |
| 18. | Iliovasilema                          | F6b   | 32m    | Difficult start and tricky finish.                                                                                                      |
