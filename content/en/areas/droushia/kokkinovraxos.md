Small, but high quality crag. The crag sports several vertical crack lines and overhangs gently the entire length. Home to several challenging trad lines.
# Directions

Follow instructions for Gerakopetra. From the parking area at the top of Gerakopetra head south, passing an (as yet) undeveloped crag, and continue until the orange, 10 degree overhanging, Kokkinovraxos is reached. About 800m from the parking area.

# Aspect

Faces West and gets the sun after midday.

| 1            | Pants on Fire       | HVS 5a | 10m    | Climb straight up the obvious vertical crack that finishes at the edge of the large block extension to the crag.                                                                                     |
