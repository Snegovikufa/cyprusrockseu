Interesting crag, until now difficult to access due to the vegetation. Now lovingly cleaned up by locals, and a set of worthy sports routes set up ranging from easy to hard.

# Directions

Follow instructions Gerakopetra, but stop before the track drops down to Gerakopetra, and park in the small clearing on the left next to a boulder (useful warm up traversing around it). The back of Konefti is the rock opposite the parking area. To find the climbing, go back onto the track towards Gerakopetra, follow this for about 10m, then pick up the path on the right (marked by a cairn) and follow it to the base of the crag and start of the routes (approx 100m).

# Aspect
Faces North west/North From late morning. Descent location for early morning climbing during summer, or afternoon onwards winter.
