Decent crag reaching 35m in places. Home to a few trad lines. Scope for several more.

# Directions

Starting from Ineia, pass through the village heading west. Pass the coop bank and coffee shop on the right, and at the three way crossroads take the lower (left) road. Follow the small road for approx 1km. As it loses height another small road will appear as a sharp left turn. Take this turn and the crag can be found on the right after 50m.

# Aspect

Faces South/South East Gets the sun most of the day.
