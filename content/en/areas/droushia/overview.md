This beautiful area on the west coast of Cyprus is:

1. a beatiful sector with a lot of lead climbing. Start with [Gerakopetra]({{<ref "gerakopetra" >}}).
2. a boulder jungle of mostly great quality sandstone with a potential of 300+ problems. There are lots of topos on the [27crags](https://27crags.com/crags/inia-droushia).
