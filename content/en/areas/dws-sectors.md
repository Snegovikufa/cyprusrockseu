# Overview

Deep water soloing/Psicobloc is in it's infancy in Cyprus. There are only a few places known, but doubtless more to be discovered, where the practitioner can practise the dark (and damp) art. Only the bare bones of the locations are (mostly) given. It's up to the reader to use their own exploratory instincts to flesh them out. Adds to the experience, no?

## [Pyla/Potamos]({{<ref "/areas/pyla/potamos" >}})

An area of Sea Caves about 1km east of the Pyla sector, towards the village of Potamos. Extends for more than a kilometer, and has plenty of potential. Minimal exploration so far, but for what is known visit: [Pyla/Potamos]({{<ref "/areas/pyla/potamos" >}}) DWS area Can be easily combined with visits to the Pyla sector.

## Cavo Greko - Agia Anargiri Chapel

One of the most beautiful spots for DWS. Downclimb to the underneath part of the bridge and then climb on the "roof". Routes are approximately 6c/7a.

Please be very attentive to tourists jumping from the bridge.
