Newly developed limestone crag located close to the large village of Episkopi, about 10km west of Limassol. The routes are around 10-14m in length, mostly with difficult starts and low-down cruxes.

# Directions

From the Limassol-Pafos highway take the number 35 turnoff and head south towards the centre of Episkopi village. After around 1km pass the Episkopiana hotel on the right and take the turning on the right immediately after the hotel. Continue past the school and follow the small road as it winds down into the small valley. The crags can be seen on the left after around 3km. Either park just off the road directly facing the crag and follow the route to the crag shown in blue on the picture, or continue for 100m and park close to the junction with the dirt track. In the latter case follow the (reasonably) obvious hunter's track to the base of the crag. Whichever route you take, keep a bit of an eye out for snakes just in case!

# Aspect

Faces North Mostly doesn't get the sun except very early in the morning/late in the evening. This makes it a good summer option.

# Notes

There is also a fair smattering of decent boulders, some of which have nice (if sandy) landings.
