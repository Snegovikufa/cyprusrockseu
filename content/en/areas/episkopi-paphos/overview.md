The massive upper sector (up to around 60m) is essentially undeveloped, and subject to access issues - which is a shame as it could be developed into a world class sector.

**Note**: There are a few bolted routes on the upper sector. These should not be climbed until further notice.

The lower tier(s) are mostly overhanging, up to around 20m, and contain hard sport routes mostly in the upper 7s and throughout the 8s. There is an [excellent guide](www.kyriakosrossidis.com/2019/01/24/rock-climbing-in-episkopi-paphos/) available that gives full details of the routes, access, etc. Any information contained on this page should be considered supplementary notes to this guide, which you should seek out if you plan to visit. Any bolt donations, etc. for these sectors should preferably be given direct through the [guide]((www.kyriakosrossidis.com/2019/01/24/rock-climbing-in-episkopi-paphos/)), not through cyprusrocks.eu.

Note access is currently sensitive. If climbing on the lower tier then a very low profile should be adopted.

## Directions

![Road image](/episkopi-paphos/road.png)

Episkopi village can be easily reached due to the short distance from Paphos and it can be combined with climbing in the rest of the crags in the area. From the main roundabout in the entrance of Paphos follow the E710 road towards Episkopi which is 10km away from there. If you are driving from elsewhere and you are coming from A7 motorway it is also possible to exit and take road E606 for 6km and then turn left into an unnamed road towards the village. The sectors are in close distance from everywhere in the village so you can park your car and walk to the crags.

Best place to park (if not occupied) is in the space opposite this water thingy marked" ER 1953".

Then go up this small concreted road for maybe 10m, then to the right of this building. Then head north across some scrub land until you find the crag. 5 mins from car in all.

# Aspect

Faces South East, so gets the shade in the afternoon.

# Notes

The lower sectors are home to a significant colony of pigeons and bats (amongst other things). As such the environment around the sectors is not the healthiest. The left-hand sector (containing most of the better easy routes) is especially affected, where you will be standing on top of a 2cm thick carpet of pigeon guano. It is worth bearing in mind that this stuff can contain some very nasty diseases. Frequent hand sanitation is highly recommended.

Litter: Take your litter with you (that includes your cigarette butts) and if possible collect some more from the already heavily littered crag.

Toilets: Try to use your home toilet or the public toilet in the center of the village before hitting the crag. If nature calls while in the crag choose a location as far away from the crag as possible. Bury your waste and take all the paper with you. Do not bury toilet paper since animals can dig and expose it. Contrary to popular belief, toilet paper does not disintegrate easily.
