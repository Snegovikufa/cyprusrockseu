The massive upper sector (up to around 60m) is essentially undeveloped, and subject to access issues - which is a shame as it could be developed into a world class sector.

**Note**: There are a few bolted routes on the upper sector. These should not be climbed until further notice.

The lower tier(s) are mostly overhanging, up to around 20m, and contain hard sport routes mostly in the upper 7s and throughout the 8s. There is an [excellent guide](www.kyriakosrossidis.com/2019/01/24/rock-climbing-in-episkopi-paphos/) available that gives full details of the routes, access, etc. Any information contained on this page should be considered supplementary notes to this guide, which you should seek out if you plan to visit. Any bolt donations, etc. for these sectors should preferably be given direct through the [guide]((www.kyriakosrossidis.com/2019/01/24/rock-climbing-in-episkopi-paphos/)), not through cyprusrocks.eu.

Note access is currently sensitive. If climbing on the lower tier then a very low profile should be adopted.

# Directions

Follow the directions in the [guide](www.kyriakosrossidis.com/2019/01/24/rock-climbing-in-episkopi-paphos/). Best place to park (if not occupied) is in the space opposite this water thingy marked" ER 1953".

Then go up this small concreted road for maybe 10m, then to the right of this building. Then head north across some scrub land until you find the crag. 5 mins from car in all.

# Notes

The lower sectors are home to a significant colony of pigeons and bats (amongst other things). As such the environment around the sectors is not the healthiest. The left-hand sector (containing most of the better easy routes) is especially affected, where you will be standing on top of a 2cm thick carpet of pigeon guano. It is worth bearing in mind that this stuff can contain some very nasty diseases. Frequent hand sanitation, and/or masks, are highly recommended (not exactly a foreign prospect in these times!).
