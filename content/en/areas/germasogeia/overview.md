Almost gritstone like edge, extending for a few hundred metres. Not very high, but surprisingly solid. Essentially undeveloped and worth an exploration.

# Directions

Heading east out of Limasol on the A6, take the Germasogeia turn-off. Pass through Germasogeia village, and continue as far as Germasogeia reservoir. The crags can be seen on the opposite side of the reservoir. Getting to the base of the edge is tricky but possible.

# Aspect

Faces West Gets the from early afternoon onwards.
