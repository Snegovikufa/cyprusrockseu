A small scrappy crag, with a few half decent trad routes. One tufa feature provides the best route at the crag.

# Directions

From Episkopi take the B6 heading west. Continue on the B6, passing through the army base. After passing the school (on the right) the road descends quite sharply for 800m. Where this levels out there is a small road to the right - just before the main road bends left and re-ascends. This road is sign-posted for Agios Georges - take it and continue for approx 400m. A rough track can be seen on the left leading up to the crags. Park opposite the track and follow it on foot for 10 mins until the crags are reached.

# Aspect

Faces South Receives sun from early morning to late afternoon.

# Notes

The routes listed as <Route X> are somewhat bold and have not yet been properly led. The grades given for these routes are thus approximate and they remain as yet unnamed.

The grass leading up to the crag is absolutely evil from late spring through to autumn. This, combined with its south facing sheltered low level location, makes it a strictly winter crag. Care should be taken with snakes.

Further up the valley, beyond Agios Georges, there are several promising boulders - clearly seen on the west side of the track that heads up the valley.

# Gear

Nuts, hexes and prussik loops. Narrow dynema slings for belays are useful.

# Descent

Descent is via the small gully to the right of Meeti.

# Route Summary

7 trad (D to E2)
