# Overview

The area around the Agios Georgios climbing area is home to a few dozen boulders that offer some OK-ish problems, mostly in the easier grades. Quite a few are high ball, so could be considered easy solo-ing. Whilst not really worth making a special trip, if you are in the area than it is a nice place to spend a pleasant evening pottering around. As many of the problems are around the V0 grade, a bouldering mat probably isn't necessary.

Most of the boulders are south facing, so a bit hot during the summer. Watch out for snakes (and army types doing 'commando' training). A large aggressive dog seems fairly effective in repelling both these obstacles. The following topos highlight some of the problems unearthed so far. There are quite a few boulders that still need cleaned, so plenty of potential for new problems.
