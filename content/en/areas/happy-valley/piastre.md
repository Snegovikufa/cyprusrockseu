A decent small crag, unfortunately on SBA restricted land, and in theory a pass is needed for access. However, as the SBA widely uses (trashes?) other crags on the island, utilising the fixed gear without contributing to their up keep (shame on them) I'd be inclined to go for it. If challenged ask for a contribution to the bolt fund.

# Update

Sadly all these routes have been retro-bolted (and not very well), so instead of a few half-decent trad routes, we now have a bunch of (frankly) poor sport routes. No idea why they did that - presumably the current crop of military types don't have the cojones of their fore-fathers. And it's not as if it wasn't easy to set top-ropes up if you so desired. Shame.
