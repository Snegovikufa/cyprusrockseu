# Overview

Superb spot for climbing, overlooking the coastline and a fair distance from any sounds other than those of the wind and the birds. The ruins of the monastery just add to the enjoyment.

Enormous potential all around.

The slab consists of easy friendly routes, but is sandwiched by two harder propositions.

The multipitch, some 7-8 minutes' walk away along the westbound Besparmak trail, is a great excursion.

Unless otherwise stated, the routes were bolted by Mustafa, with help from Niyazi, Samira, Halil and Gökhan.

# Aspect

Faces north.

# Directions

From the highest point in Karsiyaka village, dirt tracks lead up to monastery ruins. Bear right at the monastery, to find the carpark 100m further up on the right and marked with a cairn. Footpaths zigzag towards the triangular face (Delta) at the Eastern end of a crag facing the sea.
