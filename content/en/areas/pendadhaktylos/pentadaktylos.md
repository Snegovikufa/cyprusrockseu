Known also as Besparmak and 5 fingers, the mountain was climbed extensively in the 1960s and. Locals are now re-climbing and checking the old routes and adding many more. Loose rock abounds in the little climbed areas, so care is advised, but for adventure climbing this is truly a splendid hill.

# Aspect

Faces south so mostly in the sun.
