# Notes

Moving around the route starts is difficult due to the prickly bushes that festoon the base of the area. Taking some basic gardening gear is highly recommended.
The information provided doesn't yet cover route descriptions - which can be handy for trad routes. If you have any queries about specific routes then contact the admin and this can be provided for a small contribution to the bolt fund.

# Gear

Normal rack - hexes are probably more useful than cams.

# Descent

Access to the routes is by rappelling from somewhere near the top of the route Pulse.
