# Overview

A great area, 1.5km long or more, full of caves and clear enough of rocks beneath for some great DWS routes. Minimal exploration so far as access is not trivial, but it has potential for a variety of problems, most especially arching overhangs.

It's located on the south south-east edge of the UK base area. Most convenient is to go round by boat (20min from Potamos), but it is looks accessible by road + dingy. If a red flag is up near the shore by the mine, it means a live firing practice is going on and the area should be avoided.
