# Overview

A highball limestone crag, the rock is a bit soft, as such holds tend to break, particularly on the lines that haven't yet been climbed. The more it is climbed however the more secure the climbs will be. Some great quality lines just 15 minutes from Limassol. Keep an out for snakes, particularly in the summer months.

# Aspect

Faces south, most of the day in the sun.

# Directions

![Image](/sotira/map.jpg)

Take the A6 from Limassol to Paphos, take the exit for Sotira, while going over the A6 towards sotira you will notice the crag opposite you, stay on this road for a few minutes. Head through the village going straight at the first junction. Just after this the road becomes steeper, at the top of the hill, opposite the sign for the village hall take a right onto a concrete inclining road that will turn into a dirt road, follow this for a few minutes and park opposite the farm before the dirt road becomes too bad. the crag will be just below.

| ---------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Warm up Right          | f6B   | Start as for the warm up route but from the jug go right via a series of sidepulls and slopers to get on to an undercut, mantling up this                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Helicopters in the sky | f6C   | Sit start to the warm up route, start below the mini-roof on jugs and make a couple of tricky moves to get the good pocket above the lip and finish up the warm up.                                                                                                                                       |
| Jump                   | f6C+  | The obvious line a few meters right of the warm up route, start standing on the wall with LH on a good tufa pinch and jump for a 3 finger pocket to the right. Go up.                                                                                                                                     |
| Kourkoutas             | f6C   | Left of unnamed below the 2 jugs, go up direct through pockets getting to better holds below the flakey side pull finishing up.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Komodo Dragon          | f7A+  | Start on the grey tufa pinches under a hole in the roof, about 7 meters to the left of Kourkoutas, traverse right along the break(chossy in places) to get under Kourkoutas finishing up this. Very tiring.                                                                                               |
| Unnamed                | f6B+  | Start on the break below a broken tufa, approx. 10m to the right of Jump going for the broken tufa. Go up, feels harder before unlocking the sneaky beta. Care should be taken on the potentially loose block around halfway up the problem.                                                              |
| The Mask               | f6C   | Start on the break slightly to the right of the 6b+, below the feature looking like a face that's halfway up the wall. Crimp your way up to the face and head left(Careful of the potentially loose block when moving left) into the groove finishing up this.                                            |
| Poseidonas             | f7B+  | Start as for Komodo Dragon on the tufa pinches below the hole on the roof but this time climb out of the roof to the good hold on the lip making a couple of powerful moves to gain the pocket in the middle of water streak at about half height continuing up to top out. Best line at the crag by far. |
