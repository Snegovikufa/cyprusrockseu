A new venue in one of the few climbable venues in the Troodos hills. It is a bit loose in places and requires some care. Home to 5 (at present) sports routes on a (mostly) easy angled slab.

# Directions

Approach from the B9. Take the Kakopetria turnoff onto the small road that heads towards Prodromos. Continue on this road for nearly 4 km until the the Agios Nicolaos water plant is reached. About 200m after this is a small track on the left, marking the end of the Agios Nicolaos Kannoures trail and sporting a sign with a climber. Follow this track (4x4 recommended) for around 3 km until a fork in the road is reached, with the left one barred by a barrier and sign warning against rock fall. Park here follow the left track on foot (the one with the barrier) for 500m, after which the climbing sector appears on the right beside the path.

# Aspect

Faces South East, at an elevation of 1150m. In the shade from mid-afternoon onwards. Quite a nice spot of an evening during the summer.

# Notes

Helmet advised for climber and belayer.Potential for a few decent trad routes up the steeper rocks about 20m to the right of the sports routes.
A few hundred metres further up the valley, on the other side of the stream, is a 120m 4 pitch route which goes at around 5c.
