Remote sector in a pleasant location overlooking the Xeros river valley. The rock here provides pleasant movement oriented climbing, requiring a variety of climbing techniques in surprisingly exposed positions. There is a bit of looseness to the rock in places.

# Directions
Directions described as if approaching from Pafos. Take the F617 towards Salamiou. Just before entering the village of Salamiou take the road on the left (signposted Panagia tou Sinti - difficult to see until passed the turning). Continue down the road to the river bed - approx 5km (becomes gravelled track towards end). Cross the concrete ford to reach the other side of the river, and take the right fork. Track becomes rough for around 200m. As the track rises back up the other side of the valley it improves and becomes tarmac again. Follow this for about 3km (you can see the destination on the right). When a small habitation can be seen hiding on the right, take the small track next to it. Follow this for around 1km until the crag is reached. Parking on the grassy verge. The sector can also be driven to via the village of Galataria - in which refer to the google map link.

# Aspect

Faces South West. Gets the sun from mid morning onwards. A large tree in the middle provides welcome shade in warmer weather whilst between routes.

# Notes

Many of the route names are unknown. The grades need confirmation. The rock can be a little loose. Some lower offs are carabiners, others are ring bolts.

| 3.  | Xeros      | F6b   | 23m    | Lovely route up the steep wall just right of the previous route. Some of the holds are a little fragile.                            |
| 4.  |            | F6a   | 23m    | Great climbing on a variety of holds. Lay-backs, hand jams, exposure - this route has them all. One of the best 6a's on the island. |

| 5.  |             | F6b   | 22m    | Nice varied route starts on the ledge behind the bush. Tricky crux at around the half-way mark.                                                              |
| 6.  | Sweet honey | F6a+  | 22m    | Surprisingly nice route with some funky moves. Beware loose blocks when pulling onto the ledge at two thirds height.                                         |
| 7.  |             | F6a+  | 18m    | Start 2m right of the previous one. Go up just left of obvious layback onto ledge and trend slightly right to finish middle of the wall a bit below the top. |
| 8.  |             | F6a+  | 14m    | Shortish route, but with nice moves.                                                                                                                         |

| 9.  |            | F5c   | 16m    | Route directly behind tree. Takes vertical crack.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10. |            | F6a+  | 19m    | Route directly behind and to the right ot the tree. Tricky to grade as depends how far away from bolts you stray. Taken direct is probably a full grade harder than listed here.                                                  |
| 11. |            | F5b   | 24m    | Found on the far right of the sector. Pleasant climbing on occasionally dubious rock.                                                                                                                                             |
| 12. | Safari     | F6a   | 24m    | Another nice route 2m to the right of the previous one. The lower off is at the top and gives great views over the entire Xeros valley. Take a flask of tea up and enjoy. Can be somewhat loose - helmet recommended for belayer. |
