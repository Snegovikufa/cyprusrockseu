This is one of the most picturesque climbing areas of Northern Cyprus. There are two main crags overlooking the nearby sea, the taller Upper Crag about 120m high and lying more toward the west, and the longer Lower Crag, about 60-70m high. The Upper Crag has several large bush-filled ledges and both contain very large caves. There are also several arches, one of which is around 25m high and hosts a trad route on the eastern leg.

# Directions

The crag is accessible from below by scrambling through brush which is at times very dense and full of thorns (trails are in process). The Lower Crag has a trail running at the base. There is a dirt road running to the top of the Upper Crag and a small concrete hut right on top (this is a useful belay/rappel station).

Beware of blunt-nose vipers when approaching! There are many of them.
Also beware of a plant called "rue", it causes painful blistering rash when the affected skin is later exposed to sunlight.
