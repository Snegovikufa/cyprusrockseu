Aside from the obvious (sit on beaches, work on your sun tan, etc.) the following are all well catered for in Cyprus:

* Mountain biking - several companies can arrange the hire of bikes and provide trail information.
* Hiking - free trail information is available from the [Cyprus Tourist Organisation](https://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/).
* [Water sports](https://www.cypruswatersports.com/) - wind surfing, sailing, kite surfing, etc.
* [Hang gliding and para-gliding](https://www.paraglidingmap.com/sites/Cyprus/).
* Go skiing - Cyprus has a short but reliable skiing season on [Mount Olympus](http://www.skicyprus.com/). You can quite easily ski in the morning and sun-bathe on the beach in the afternoon.
* Diving - Cyprus has some quite good [diving sites](https://diveadvisor.com/cyprus).
* Take in the extensive [archaeological sights](http://www.cyprus-archaeology.org.uk/).
* Use Cyprus as a jumping off point for other major climbing regions. Easy access exists to climbing in Egypt, Jordan, and The Lebanon.
