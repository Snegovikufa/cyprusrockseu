Aside from the obvious (sit on beaches, work on your sun tan, etc.) the following are all well catered for in Cyprus:

* Mountain biking - several companies can arrange the hire of bikes and provide trail information.
* [Hiking](https://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/) - free trail information is available from the Cyprus Tourist Organisation. You can also find trails on the [Wikiloc](https://www.wikiloc.com/trails/hiking/cyprus).
* [Water sports](https://www.cypruswatersports.com/) - wind surfing, sailing, kite surfing, etc.
* [Hang gliding and para-gliding](https://www.paraglidingmap.com/sites/Cyprus/).
* [Go skiing](http://www.skicyprus.com/) - Cyprus has a short but reliable skiing season on Mount Olympus. You can quite easily ski in the morning and sun-bathe on the beach in the afternoon.
* [Diving](https://diveadvisor.com/cyprus) - Cyprus has some quite good diving sites.
* Take in the extensive [archaeological sights](http://www.cyprus-archaeology.org.uk/).
* Use Cyprus as a jumping off point for other major climbing regions. Easy access exists to climbing in Egypt, Jordan, and The Lebanon.
