Where to stay will be partially dictated by whether you want to concentrate on sport, trad climbing, or both. Other factors to consider are the time of year, and what else you want to do whilst in Cyprus.

The most varied climbing on the island is in the West with [Droushia/Ineia]({{<ref "/areas/droushia/overview" >}}) offering sport, trad, and bouldering in abundance, and [Dhiarizos]({{<ref "/areas/dhiarizos/overview" >}}) offering the best sports routes in Cyprus. The west of the island is generally a few degrees cooler than the east, and during high summer offers the only real viable climbing opportunities. Pafos is one of the main holiday resorts on the island and will be the obvious choice for many. Polis, on the north west coast, is a quieter alternative to Pafos, and is very close to Droushia.

If you want to concentrate on trad climbing, then [Cavo Greko]({{<ref "/areas/cavo-greko/overview" >}}) would be the logical choice, especially if visiting out of season. For those starting out in traditional climbing, or those that prefer easier routes, then Greko must be one of the best places to visit in Europe. It offers:

* Numerous routes in the lower grades, some multi-pitch.
* Good, often easily placed, protection.
* Great scenery and atmosphere.
* No overcrowding of routes (most days you will be the only climbing visitors).
* Easy access.
* Plentiful local facilities.
* Reliable weather (but don't come in the summer). 

Agia Napa, a well known resort, provides lots of accommodation and facilities and is just 10 minutes drive away. Although notorious during summer (when it's much too hot to climb any way), off-season it's a much more quiet place. Protaras, also close to Greko, is another alternative. It is also possible to base oneself in Larnaca, which is about 40 minutes away from Greko.

If you want to sample several of the areas in Cyprus, then it would be possible to base oneself around Limassol. From here all areas can be driven to within 70-80 minutes, and [Happy Valley]({{<ref "/areas/happy-valley/overview" >}}) is on your doorstep. The main tourist area around Limassol is the Amathus area, just to the east of Limassol proper. Here there are numerous hotels and apartments. Alternatively, if cities aren't your cup of tea, one of the Troodos hill villages would offer a more peaceful experience, and allow you to sample 'real' Cyprus amongst the locals. During summer the weather is cooler and fresher. Platres and Agros are two of the main resorts, but villas are available for rent in most of the larger villages.
