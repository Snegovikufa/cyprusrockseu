Climbing and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions.

The traditional climbing areas in Cyprus are not extensively climbed. Whilst this means that the visitor is almost certain to have a particular crag or sector to themselves, it also means that the usual cleaning of loose rock that occurs in more popular climbing regions may not have occurred. Even more care should be taken than usual in assessing the quality of the rock. If in doubt bail out, or inspect the route on top-rope first.

The lack of traffic on routes also means that the usual consensus process with regards route grading has not taken place. Whilst the grading of most routes is generally believed to be accurate, this cannot be guaranteed. If a route looks harder than its listed grade, then it probably is.

In the author's experience the grading of routes in the Greko area are somewhat 'kinder' than those on other parts of the island.

Cyprus does not provide the rescue services that you may exist in your country. Bare this in mind.
