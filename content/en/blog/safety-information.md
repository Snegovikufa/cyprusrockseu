Cyprus is a hot country! Take plenty of water and be on your guard against heat-stroke, which has a habit of taking you unawares. Be especially vigilant when setting up belays at the top of routes, when you will be in full glare of the sun even if the route itself is in the shade.

Cyprus is home to several species of poisonous snake, one of which (the blunt nosed viper) is particularly nasty. However, snakes are shy creatures, and not prone to attacking humans unless provoked. Unfortunately, snakes enjoy the sort of environment that climbers do, so care should be taken to avoid provoking them inadvertently. Take care when ploughing through long grass (make plenty of noise and disturbance to warn snakes that may be in your path, and keep an eye out for snakes basking on rocks. In the unlikely event of being bitten then seek immediate medical advice. All hospitals and private clinics keep stocks of anti-venom. It is worth pointing out that the most common snake in Cyprus, the black whip snake, is not venomous.

The traditional climbing areas in Cyprus are not extensively climbed. Whilst this means that the visitor is almost certain to have a particular crag or sector to themselves, it also means that the usual cleaning of loose rock that occurs in more popular climbing regions may not have occurred. Even more care should therefore be taken than usual in assessing the quality of the rock. If in doubt bail out, or inspect the route on top-rope first.

The lack of traffic on routes also means that the usual consensus process with regards route grading has not taken place. Whilst the grading of most routes is generally believed to be accurate, this cannot be guaranteed. If a route looks harder than its listed grade, then it probably is.

In the author's experience the grading of routes in the Greko area are somewhat 'kinder' than those on other parts of the island.

Cyprus does not provide the rescue services that you may exist in your country. Bear this in mind. That said, in case of emergency call 112 and ask for EMAK (a police division which has (in theory) the knowledge and equipment to effect a rescue). If sufficiently serious ask for air evacuation. Note this only applies to climbing in the south of the island.
