A compact, but excellent crag. Home to probably the best sport routes on the island. The rock is a hard limestone, reaching heights of 28m. The crag is split into several sectors and in such a way that it is always possible to climb in the shade.

## Directions

To find the crag, follow the B6 heading east from Pafos. About 14km east of Pafos, take the F616 road northwards situated just east of the AsproKemmos dam (signposted Mamonia, Agios Georgios, Agios Nikolaos). Continue on this road following the line of the Dhiarizos river for 10km. Continue through Agios Georgios and for another 4km, passing the Extreme View cafe. The crag becomes visible a few hundred metres further as the road drops down. Obvious parking area on the left.
## Aspect

Faces all directions. Always something in the shade (or the sun). Timings are based on summer hours.

# Notes

Great all year round crag. Takes a day or so to dry out after sustained rain (rare).
Busy (by Cyprus standards) at weekends and holidays during the Spring and Autumn.
The Extreme View Cafe, located 1 km back up the road to Pafos, is highly recommended.

Please be aware that birds sometimes nest in the top of the crack a third of the way up Khoros tis Siopis (main slab) and in the top of the flake half-way up Kalitechnis (main wall). Try to avoid these routes if it looks like this has happened (usually April through May).

# Route Summary

65 sport (3 to 7c+)

## Top Parking Area

Short vertical to mildly overhanging wall containing a couple of (very) sharp, but worthwhile routes. Located at the top parking area up the short bank. Gets sun from around mid-day

|#|Name|Grade|Length|Description|
|------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
|1|Alex Drastico F6c+|9m|Steep, short, bouldery route with nice (if painful) moves.|
|2|Alchemistis|F7a|14m|Similar to Alex Drastico, except more so. One for the masochists.|
|3|Unknown|F3|15m|This can be found about 8m to the right of the previous two, hidden by the trees. Easy but pleasant climbing. Suitable for nervous beginners or young children.|
